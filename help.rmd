# Introduction  <a name="introduction"></a>

This Shiny application is an interactive interface to parts of the R package **secr** ([Efford 2020](#references)). The current source code is available from https://GitHub.com/MurrayEfford/secrapp. Documentation of **secr** is available at www.otago.ac.nz/density. For example:

<a href="https://www.otago.ac.nz/density/pdfs/secr-manual.pdf"; target="_blank";>secr-manual.pdf</a>   (details of each function)  
<a href="https://www.otago.ac.nz/density/pdfs/secr-datainput.pdf"; target="_blank";>secr-datainput.pdf</a>  
<a href="https://www.otago.ac.nz/density/pdfs/secr-overview.pdf"; target="_blank";>secr-overview.pdf</a>

The analyses available through the Shiny app are a subset of those in **secr**. Support for multi-session analyses is limited.

TIP: on small displays, running your browser in full-screen mode will avoid the need to scroll down (often F11 will get you there; otherwise try the options menu of the browser).

# Main screen  <a name="main"></a>

*Use settings on this page to input data and fit simple models.*

## Data input

By default, input is from two text files, one for the detector layout and one for detections ('captures') of known individuals. Alternatively, secrapp may  read the secr capthist object from a .rds file.

### Detector layout

The detector layout is input from a text file. The file typically should have three columns (trapID, x, y) with no headers. These may optionally be followed by binary usage codes (0/1), one per occasion. Columns after a '/' are interpreted as detector covariates. 

Options for <u>detector type</u>  follow **secr** ([Efford (2020)](#references)): "multi" refers to a multi-catch trap; "proximity" to binary proximity detectors, and "count" to detectors that yield integer counts. Counts are assumed to be Poisson-distributed. Data from searches of areas or transects use the types "polygon", "polygonX", "transect" or "transectX" (Efford 2011; see also [secr-polygondetectors.pdf]).

If detector covariates are included then one or more covariate names should be provided (without quotes, separated by commas).

Optional arguments separated by commas may be used to customise input (e.g., `skip`, which is passed through `read.traps` to `read.table`). 

### Captures

Two formats are allowed, as in DENSITY or **secr**; 'trapID' uses four columns (Session, AnimalID, Occasion, TrapID) and 'XY' uses five (Session, AnimalID, Occasion, X, Y). Supplementary columns are interpreted as individual covariates.

If individual covariates are included then the correct number of covariate names should be provided (without quotes, separated by commas).

Optional arguments separated by commas may be used to customise input (e.g., `skip`, which is passed to `read.table`). 

## Model

<table style="width:80%">
  <tr>
    <td> Detection function </td>
    <td> HN &nbsp; halfnormal &nbsp; \( \small g(d) = -g_0 \exp\{-d^2/(2\sigma^2)\} \) </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> </td>
    <td> HR &nbsp; hazard rate  &nbsp; \( \small  g(d) = -g_0 (1 - \exp(-(d/\sigma)^{-z})) \) </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> </td>
    <td> EX &nbsp; negative exponential  &nbsp; \( \small  g(d) = -g_0 \exp(-d/\sigma) \) </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> </td>
    <td> HHN &nbsp; hazard halfnormal  &nbsp; \( \small  \lambda(d) = -\lambda_0 \exp(-d^2/(2\sigma^2)) \) </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> </td>
    <td> HHR &nbsp; hazard hazard rate  &nbsp; \( \small  \lambda(d) = -\lambda_0 (1 - \exp(-(d/\sigma)^{-z})) \)  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> </td>
    <td> HEX &nbsp; hazard negative exponential  &nbsp; \( \small  \lambda(d) = -\lambda_0 \exp(-d/\sigma) \) </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Likelihood</td>
    <td>maximize full likelihood or likelihood conditional on \( \small n\)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Distribution</td>
    <td>distribution of number detected \( \small n\)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mixture hcov</td>
    <td>name of covariate</td>
  </tr>
</table> 

<br>

The supported <u>detection functions</u> are a subset of those allowed in **secr** (currently 'HN', 'HR', 'EX', 'HHN', 'HHR', 'HEX'). 
These relate either the probability (g(d)) or hazard (\( \small \lambda\)) of detection at a particular detector on a particular sampling occasion  to the distance \( \small d\) of the detector from its home-range centre. The probability of detection is \( \small g(d) = 1 - \exp \{ - \lambda(d)\}\).

<a name="distribution"></a>

The <u>Distribution</u> radio button toggles between two models for the number of detected individuals $n$. The "Binomial" option corresponds to fixed number $N$ in the masked area and a binomial point process for the distribution of activity centres.  The "Poisson" option corresponds to Poisson $N$ and a Poisson point process for activity centres. 

<a name="hcov"></a>

The <u>Mixture hcov</u> select input allows the user to choose a variable defining a mixture class from among the individual covariates. This is passed to `secr.fit` as the argument 'hcov'. The covariate should take two non-missing values (e.g., 'F','M'); missing values are allowed. The mixing proportion 'pmix' is included in the model automatically when hcov is specified. To estimate mixture-specific values of a parameter include ~h2 in its formula (e.g., lambda0~h2). See <a href="https://www.otago.ac.nz/density/pdfs/secr-finitemixtures.pdf"; target="_blank";>secr-finitemixtures.pdf</a> for more.

Other arguments separated by commas may be used to customise the call to `secr.fit`. Attempts here to change 'capthist', 'mask', 'model' or 'detectfn' are ignored, and 'trace' is always FALSE.

Model formulae may be edited using pre-defined predictors or covariate names as described in <a href="https://www.otago.ac.nz/density/pdfs/secr-overview.pdf"; target="_blank";>secr-overview.pdf</a>. Time covariates ('timecov') and session covariates ('sessioncov') may be specified in 'Other arguments'. There is no provision for time-varying detector covariates.

## Time limits

The application is designed for small- to medium-sized models. An internal algorithm predicts the execution time by evaluating the likelihood once and making a simple extrapolation. The prediction is quite rough. When the predicted time exceeds a lower threshold ('timewarning', default 0.5 minutes) a dialog box asks the user for confirmation before proceeding. If the predicted time exceeds an upper threshold ('timelimit', default 10 minutes) then execution aborts, with a notification at the lower right of the screen. The thresholds may be changed in the R code of the app.R file (near the top).

## Actions

<table style="width:60%">
  <tr>
    <td>Fit model</td>
    <td>Fit closed-population SECR model</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reset all</td>
    <td>Reset all input options to defaults</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Bookmark</td>
    <td> (see Bookmarking)</td>
  </tr>
</table> 

<br>
'Reset all' does not delete Summary results from the current session. Use the 'Clear all' and 'Delete last' buttons on the Summary page to manage the summaries. Summary results will be lost if you close the application without downloading to a local file.

The option 'Switch to secrdesign' appears once a model has been fitted if the detection function is HHN or HEX and the detector type is multi, proximity or count. This opens 'secrdesignapp' on the Otago University server in a new browser window. Settings and parameter estimates are transferred automatically. Detector locations are not transferred; they should be provided either by selecting the file in secrdesignapp, or by the usual options (Grid, Line, Region).

## Results  <a name="results"></a>

*Values in the Results window are updated automatically when the inputs change.*

The default results vary depending on the inputs

* summary of detector layout only
* summary of capthist object (detector layout + detections)
* summary of fitted model

Once a model has been fitted it is possible to select 

* summary of fitted model
* table(s) of estimates from `predict`
* table of `derived` (Horvitz-Thompson) estimates
* some other summary function that takes the fitted model as an argument.

## Tabbed code and plots

*Plots update automatically. Any plot may be saved by right-clicking on the image.*

### Code

R statements for the main operations. These expand once you browse to specific detector and capture files. 

The statements may be copied and pasted into an R session. It is assumed that input files are in the current folder; you may need to change this with `setwd()`.

### Array

A plot of the current detector layout. Detections are overplotted if they have been uploaded.

By default, the locations of one animal are highlighted. Suppress this by selecting animal '0'.

A session selector is shown for multi-session data. Changing the session changes the plot displayed on this tab, and on some others (Buffer, Pxy, Dxy); it does not affect model fitting.

Once a model has been fitted, ticking 'fxi contour' displays a contour plot of probability density contours for the activity centre of the current animal. This may fail if the mask spacing is too small.

### Moves

Histogram of distances between the successive detections of each animal. The bar width is determined internally from an integer value provided to the 'breaks' argument of `hist`. You can vary the 'Nominal breaks' setting (small changes have no effect because of the algorithm used by `hist`).

Summary statistics appear in a box to the right. "Approx HN sigma" is computed with the **secr** function `RPSV(capthist, CC = TRUE)`; the approximation is an underestimate, especially when the detector array is small.

Non-exclusive detector types (proximity, count etc.) allow multiple detections on a single occasion, and the order of these detections is unknown. The distances then depend on the arbitrary within-occasion ordering of detections.

For multi-session data the displayed histogram is for the current session (see Array tab), unless 'Combine sessions' has been selected on the Options screen. When sessions are combined, the default is to include session-session movements. This may be changed on the Options screen. 

### Detectfn   <a name="detectfnplot"></a>

Fitted detection function on the hazard and probability scales.

### Buffer   <a name="esaplot"></a>

Predicted effect of buffer width on density estimates. The plot is generated with `esa.plot(fit)`. A red vertical line indicates the buffer that was used (there is no line when the mask has been read from a file).

### Pxy

Contours of the overall detection probability \( \small p_\cdot(\mathbf x)\) under the fitted model ('Pxy' is the label that has been used for this quantity in the Windows application Density).  Settings in Options toggle the display between filled and unfilled contour plots, and determine whether contours are labelled. The requested contour levels are 0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.9, but higher contours may be missing. Click on the plot to find the value at a point.

### Dxy

A plot of the fitted density model with various optional overlays:

* detector locations (red crosses)
* petal plot of detections
* one simulated population from the fitted model
* circles with 95% home range for each centre in the simulated population

### Power

Two styles of plot are offered (see Options | Power plot)

#### Power for test of null hypothesis 

Probability of detecting a change in density in a 2-survey comparison as a function of effect size for a given expected \( \small \mbox{RSE}(\hat D)\). See Efford and Boulanger (2019) for the computation method.

Effect size is the ratio of final density \( \small D_2\) to initial density \( \small D_1\) expressed as a percentage. The alpha level is specified in Options (default \( \small \alpha = 0.05\)). 

The curve is initially computed for the rule-of-thumb RSE from the current design. Use the slider to vary this. Especially, consider adding a safety margin for underestimation of RSE.

The default method assumes that \( \small \mbox{RSE}(\hat D)\) is the same in the initial and final surveys. It is more likely that \( \small \mbox{RSE}(\hat D)\) will increase as density declines. An adjustment is applied to the final RSE when the 'Adjust RSE' box is ticked:  \( \small \mbox{RSE}(\hat D_2) =   \sqrt {D_1/D_2} \mbox{RSE}(\hat D_1) \).

#### Confidence interval for population change

As an alternative to conventional power analysis we can construct intervals for the estimated ratio of densities, given the true ratio and the sampling errors. The interval is the region between the upper and lower curves for a given true population change on the x axis. 

----------------------------------------------------

# Habitat mask  <a name="habitatmask"></a>

Either construct a habitat mask from scratch ('Build') or read mask coordinates from a text file ('File'). 

For file input there should be a header line. The first two columns ('x', 'y') are read as the x- and y-coordinates. Further columns are assumed to represent covariates and their names may be used in formulae for density (D).

The 'Suggest width' button runs the **secr** function `suggest.buffer` which is currently available only for point detectors (not polygon types).

----------------------------------------------------

# Summary  <a name="summary"></a>

The table on this page has one column for each model fit or other summary; summaries are added automatically when models are fitted.

The table may be downloaded as a comma-separated text file or in the RDS format (use `readRDS` to restore in R). The table is transposed on download so that scenarios become rows.

----------------------------------------------------

# Options  <a name="optionspecs"></a>

*These should be self-explanatory. Experiment if in doubt.*


## Model fitting

### Maximization method

The default (Newton-Raphson in function `nlm`) is generally OK. Nelder-Mead in function `optim` is slower and somewhat more robust with difficult likelihood surfaces.

### Number of cores

Multithreading allows some operations to be performed in parallel for faster model fitting. The number of cores (ncores argument of `secr::secr.fit`) may be set manually. The maximum allowed by secrapp is the smaller of 24 and the number of cores available (including virtual cores)[1]. The default number of cores is half the maximum.

[1] The limit of 24 is arbitrary. It stops a user from hogging a vast number of cores in some environments. 

### Time limit

A model will not be fitted if the predicted time exceeds a limit, currently 5 minutes. The prediction is quite rough as there is no obvious way to anticipate the number of likelihood evaluations that will be required. 

----------------------------------------------------

# Troubleshooting <a name="troubles"></a>

Here are some known pitfalls

## Components of a shapefile must be selected and uploaded together

At least .shp, .dbf and .shx.

# Bookmarking  <a name="bookmark"></a>

Bookmarking creates a URL that allows you to take up your session where you left off. 

Bookmarking can be tricky. When running from GitHub on a local machine your should specify the arguments `port` and `destdir` both in the initial session that you bookmark and later when you restore it, e.g.,

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)
runGitHub("secrapp", "MurrayEfford", port = 8000, destdir = "d:/myworkingfolder")
```

The port number is arbitrary. Bookmarks are stored in a subdirectory of destdir. The URL generated by pressing the Bookmark button may be entered into your browser once you have started a new session with the same 'port' and 'destdir'. This restores all input settings and the Summary table. Also consider setting `options(shiny.port = xxxx)`. The port used by a local bookmark is saved in the values.rds file of the bookmark; if you forget it, try `readRDS("values.rds")$port`.
