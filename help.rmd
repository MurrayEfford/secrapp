# Introduction  <a name="introduction"></a>

This Shiny application is an interactive interface to parts of the R package **secr** ([Efford 2019a](#references)). It fits simple single-session models. The current source code is available from https://GitHub.com/MurrayEfford/secrapp.

Documentation of **secr** is available at www.otago.ac.nz/density. For example:

<a href="https://www.otago.ac.nz/density/pdfs/secr-manual.pdf"; target="_blank";>secr-manual.pdf</a>   (details of each function)  
<a href="https://www.otago.ac.nz/density/pdfs/secr-datainput.pdf"; target="_blank";>secr-datainput.pdf</a>  
<a href="https://www.otago.ac.nz/density/pdfs/secr-overview.pdf"; target="_blank";>secr-overview.pdf</a>

TIP: on small displays, running your browser in full-screen mode will avoid the need to scroll down (often F11 will get you there; otherwise try the options menu).

# Main screen  <a name="main"></a>

*Use settings on this page to input data and fit simple models.*

## Data input

### Trap layout

The detector layout is input from a text file. The file typically should have three columns (trapID, x, y) with no headers. Optional arguments separated by commas may be used to customise input (e.g., `skip`, which is passed through `read.traps` to `read.table`). 

Options for <u>detector type</u>  follow **secr** ([Efford (2019a)](#references)): "multi" refers to a multi-catch trap; "proximity" to binary proximity detectors, and "count" to detectors that yield integer counts. Counts are assumed to be Poisson-distributed.

### Captures

Detections ('captures') of known individuals are also input from a text file. Two formats are allowed, as in DENSITY or **secr**.


## Model
            
<table style="width:50%">
  <tr>
    <td> Detection function </td>
    <td> HHN &nbsp; hazard halfnormal &nbsp; \( \small \lambda(d) = -\lambda_0 \exp\{-d^2/(2\sigma^2)\} \) </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> </td>
    <td> HEX &nbsp; hazard negative exponential  &nbsp; \( \small \lambda(d) = -\lambda_0 \exp(-d/\sigma) \) </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Likelihood</td>
    <td>maximize full likelihood or likelihood conditional on \(n\)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Distribution</td>
    <td>distribution of number detected \(n\)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Function</td>
    <td>choose between functions used to fit model (packages secr and openCR)</td>
  </tr>
</table> 

<br>

Only two <u>detection functions</u> are supported: 'HHN' and 'HEX'. These relate an animal's hazard of detection at a particular detector on a particular sampling occasion (\(\lambda\)) to the distance \(\small d\) of the detector from its home-range centre. The corresponding probability of detection is \(\small g(d) = 1 - \exp \{ - \lambda(d)\}\).

<a name="distribution"></a>

The <u>Distribution</u> radio button toggles between two models for the number of detected individuals $n$. The "Binomial" option corresponds to fixed number $N$ in the masked area and a binomial point process for the distribution of activity centres.  The "Poisson" option corresponds to Poisson $N$ and a Poisson point process for activity centres. 


## Actions

<table style="width:40%">
  <tr>
    <td>Fit model</td>
    <td>Fit closed-population SECR model</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Add to summary</td>
    <td>Transfer results to summary table</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reset all</td>
    <td>Reset all input options to defaults</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Bookmark</td>
    <td> (see Bookmarking)</td>
  </tr>
</table> 

<br>
The option 'Switch to secrdesign' appears once a model has been fitted. This opens 'secrdesignapp' on the Otago University server in a new browser window. Settings and parameter estimates are transferred automatically (from secrdesignapp 1.2 expected late in February 2019). Detector locations are not transferred; they should be provided either by selecting the file in secrdesignapp, or by the usual options (Grid, Line, Region).

## Results  <a name="results"></a>

*Values in the Results window are updated automatically when the inputs change.*

The default results vary depending on the inputs

* summary of detector layout only
* summary of capthist object (detector layout + detections)
* summary of fitted model

Once a model has been fitted it is possible (with secr.fit) to select the table of `derived` estimates. Another summary function may also be entered by the user after selecting 'Other'; it should use the argument `fit`, meaning the fitted model.

## Tabbed plots

*Plots update automatically. Any plot may be saved by right-clicking on the image.*

### Array

A plot of the current detector layout. Detections are overplotted if they have been uploaded.

By default, the locations of one animal are highlighted. Suppress this by selecting animal '0'.

### Detectfn   <a name="detectfnplot"></a>

Fitted detection function on the hazard and probability scales.

### Popn

One simulated realisation of a uniformly distributed population from the fitted model.

### Pxy

Contours of the overall detection probability \(p_\cdot(\mathbf x)\) under the fitted model ('Pxy' is the label that has been used for this quantity in the Windows application Density).  Settings in Options toggle the display between filled and unfilled contour plots, and determine whether contours are labelled. The requested contour levels are 0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.9, but higher contours may be missing. Click on the plot to find the value at a point.

### Power

Two styles of plot are offered (see Options | Power plot)

#### Power for test of null hypothesis 

Probability of detecting a change in density in a 2-survey comparison as a function of effect size for a given expected \(\small \mbox{RSE}(\hat D)\). See the Appendix to Help in secrdesignapp for the computation method.

Effect size is the ratio of final density \(\small D_2\) to initial density \(\small D_1\) expressed as a percentage. The alpha level is specified in Options (default \(\small \alpha = 0.05\)). 

The curve is initially computed for the rule-of-thumb RSE from the current design. Use the slider to vary this. Especially, consider adding a safety margin for underestimation of RSE.

The default method assumes that \(\small \mbox{RSE}(\hat D)\) is the same in the initial and final surveys. It is more likely that \(\small \mbox{RSE}(\hat D)\) will increase as density declines. An adjustment is applied to the final RSE when the 'Adjust RSE' box is ticked:  \(\small \mbox{RSE}(\hat D_2) =   \sqrt {D_1/D_2} \mbox{RSE}(\hat D_1) \).

#### Confidence interval for population change

As an alternative to conventional power analysis we can construct intervals for the estimated ratio of densities, given the true ratio and the sampling errors. The interval is the region between the upper and lower curves for a given true population change on the x axis.

# Habitat mask  <a name="habitatmask"></a>

There is no facility at present for adding mask covariates or reading mask points from a file.

----------------------------------------------------

# Summary  <a name="summary"></a>

The table on this page has one column for each model fit or other summary; summaries are added by clicking the 'Add to summary' button on the [Main screen](#main), or automatically when models are fitted. Some fields will have missing values if no model has been fitted.

The table may be downloaded as a comma-separated text file or in the RDS format (use `readRDS` to restore in R). The table is transposed on download so that scenarios become rows.

----------------------------------------------------

# Options  <a name="optionspecs"></a>

*These should be self-explanatory. Experiment if in doubt.*

----------------------------------------------------

# Troubleshooting <a name="troubles"></a>

Here are some known pitfalls

## Components of a shapefile must be selected and uploaded together

At least .shp, .dbf and .shx.

# Bookmarking  <a name="bookmark"></a>

Bookmarking creates a URL that allows you to take up your session where you left off. 

Bookmarking can be tricky. When running from GitHub on a local machine your should specify the arguments `port` and `destdir` both in the initial session that you bookmark and later when you restore it, e.g.,

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)
runGitHub("secrdesignapp", "MurrayEfford", port = 8000, destdir = "d:/myworkingfolder")
```

The port number is arbitrary. Bookmarks are stored in a subdirectory of destdir. The URL generated by pressing the Bookmark button may be entered into your browser once you have started a new session with the same 'port' and 'destdir'. This restores all input settings and the Summary table. Also consider setting `options(shiny.port = xxxx)`. The port used by a local bookmark is saved in the values.rds file of the bookmark; if you forget it, try `readRDS("values.rds")$port`.
